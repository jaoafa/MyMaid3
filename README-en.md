This project is the source code release place of "MyMaid3 Plugin" which is the successor to "MyMaid2" which has been developed by [jaoafa/MyMaid2](https://github.com/jaoafa/MyMaid2) until now.  
It is used only by servers related to [jao Minecraft Server](https://jaoafa.com/), and it is prohibited in principle for use on servers other than that.

## License

This project license is "No License". In other words, as the default copyright law of Japan is applied, we do not allow duplication, modification, redistribution of some or all.  
(For GitHub's Fork, it is an exception because of GitHub's terms of service.)  
Originally, in the case of "No license", use is permitted unless changed. But, due to the above description, **use on non-designated servers is DISALLOWED**.  
**Please also use permission before using source code and ideas.**

### Reasons for deciding these.

I am deciding "all disallowed", because I thinking "I do not want my own creations to be used in places I do not know.".  
In the past, there were several cases where abuse of my creation and the idea of ​​function were stolen.  
We believe that "server-specific culture may be used elsewhere, there is a danger that the characteristics of the server will be diminished or problems that were not predicted will arise."  
However, There may be times when we talk in and allow it. Please contact us if you really need it.

## About the program in the project

In the source code of the program released here, perhaps there are some kind of flaws or bugs.  
However, developers and administration department / development department of jao Minecraft Server are obliged to remove these defects and bugs as much as possible, **but we are not responsible for any problems caused by them.**  
Also, you can not use all or part of or all of the functions and programs implemented in this plugin in other places without our permission.  
If you can find those bugs etc., it will be a great help if you set up a new Issue from [Issues](./issues).

## Other

The creator of this project is Japanese.  
In principle, all conversations will be conducted in Japanese, and in other languages ​​basically using translation.  
Regarding usage rights, all the description in README.md written in Japanese is given priority, and if any difference occurs, the contents written in README.md will apply.
